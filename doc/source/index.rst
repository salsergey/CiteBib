What is Citebib?
================

The best description is my usage. I have several bibtex managed with jabref. When I write an article, I pick up some references from these bibtex files. The point is that I do not want to use the big bibtex files for my article because:
* they contain unused entries
* they contain custom fields/notes

citebib reads your tex files, track \cite{} calls, and select useful fields. Then, it generates:
* a clean bibtex file,
* or a bibliography in a latex format (because some journals do not support bibtex)

The behavior is customisable from the configuration.

Given a key, citekey returns a formatted reference. (Might be useful for emails, presentations...)
